CHAPTER I
WHICH TREATS OF THE CHARACTER AND
PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS GENTLEMAN DON
QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA
IN A VILLAGE OF LA MANCHA, THE NAME OF WHICH I HAVE NO DESIRE TO CALL TO
MIND, THERE LIVED NOT LONG SINCE ONE OF THOSE GENTLEMEN THAT KEEP A LANCE IN THE
LANCE-RACK, AN OLD BUCKLER, A LEAN HACK, AND A GREYHOUND FOR COURSING. AN OLLA OF
RATHER MORE BEEF THAN MUTTON, A SALAD ON MOST NIGHTS, SCRAPS ON SATURDAYS, LENTILS
ON FRIDAYS, AND A PIGEON OR SO EXTRA ON SUNDAYS, MADE AWAY WITH THREE-QUARTERS
OF HIS INCOME. THE REST OF IT WENT IN A DOUBLET OF FINE CLOTH AND VELVET BREECHES
AND SHOES TO MATCH FOR HOLIDAYS, WHILE ON WEEK-DAYS HE MADE A BRAVE FIGURE IN
HIS BEST HOMESPUN. HE HAD IN HIS HOUSE A HOUSEKEEPER PAST FORTY, A NIECE UNDER
TWENTY, AND A LAD FOR THE FIELD AND MARKET-PLACE, WHO USED TO SADDLE THE HACK AS
WELL AS HANDLE THE BILL-HOOK. THE AGE OF THIS GENTLEMAN OF OURS WAS BORDERING ON
FIFTY; HE WAS OF A HARDY HABIT, SPARE, GAUNT-FEATURED, A VERY EARLY RISER AND A GREAT
SPORTSMAN. THEY WILL HAVE IT HIS SURNAME WAS QUIXADA OR QUESADA (FOR HERE THERE
IS SOME DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AMONG THE AUTHORS WHO WRITE ON THE SUBJECT), ALTHOUGH FROM REASONABLE CONJECTURES IT SEEMS PLAIN THAT HE WAS CALLED QUEXANA.
THIS, HOWEVER, IS OF BUT LITTLE IMPORTANCE TO OUR TALE; IT WILL BE ENOUGH NOT TO STRAY
A HAIR’S BREADTH FROM THE TRUTH IN THE TELLING OF IT.
YOU MUST KNOW, THEN, THAT THE ABOVE-NAMED GENTLEMAN WHENEVER HE WAS AT
LEISURE (WHICH WAS MOSTLY ALL THE YEAR ROUND) GAVE HIMSELF UP TO READING BOOKS OF
CHIVALRY WITH SUCH ARDOUR AND AVIDITY THAT HE ALMOST ENTIRELY NEGLECTED THE PURSUIT
OF HIS FIELD-SPORTS, AND EVEN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS PROPERTY; AND TO SUCH A PITCH
DID HIS EAGERNESS AND INFATUATION GO THAT HE SOLD MANY AN ACRE OF TILLAGELAND TO
BUY BOOKS OF CHIVALRY TO READ, AND BROUGHT HOME AS MANY OF THEM AS HE COULD
GET. BUT OF ALL THERE WERE NONE HE LIKED SO WELL AS THOSE OF THE FAMOUS FELICIANO
DE SILVA’S COMPOSITION, FOR THEIR LUCIDITY OF STYLE AND COMPLICATED CONCEITS WERE
AS PEARLS IN HIS SIGHT, PARTICULARLY WHEN IN HIS READING HE CAME UPON COURTSHIPS
AND CARTELS, WHERE HE OFTEN FOUND PASSAGES LIKE “THE REASON OF THE UNREASON WITH
WHICH MY REASON IS AFFLICTED SO WEAKENS MY REASON THAT WITH REASON I MURMUR AT
YOUR BEAUTY;” OR AGAIN, “THE HIGH HEAVENS, THAT OF YOUR DIVINITY DIVINELY FORTIFY
YOU WITH THE STARS, RENDER YOU DESERVING OF THE DESERT YOUR GREATNESS DESERVES.”
OVER CONCEITS OF THIS SORT THE POOR GENTLEMAN LOST HIS WITS, AND USED TO LIE AWAKE
STRIVING TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND WORM THE MEANING OUT OF THEM; WHAT ARISTOTLE
HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE MADE OUT OR EXTRACTED HAD HE COME TO LIFE AGAIN FOR THAT
SPECIAL PURPOSE. HE WAS NOT AT ALL EASY ABOUT THE WOUNDS WHICH DON BELIANIS
GAVE AND TOOK, BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT, GREAT AS WERE THE SURGEONS WHO HAD
CURED HIM, HE MUST HAVE HAD HIS FACE AND BODY COVERED ALL OVER WITH SEAMS AND
SCARS. HE COMMENDED, HOWEVER, THE AUTHOR’S WAY OF ENDING HIS BOOK WITH THE
PROMISE OF THAT INTERMINABLE ADVENTURE, AND MANY A TIME WAS HE TEMPTED TO TAKE
UP HIS PEN AND FINISH IT PROPERLY AS IS THERE PROPOSED, WHICH NO DOUBT HE WOULD
HAVE DONE, AND MADE A SUCCESSFUL PIECE OF WORK OF IT TOO, HAD NOT GREATER AND
MORE ABSORBING THOUGHTS PREVENTED HIM.
MANY AN ARGUMENT DID HE HAVE WITH THE CURATE OF HIS VILLAGE (A LEARNED MAN,
AND A GRADUATE OF SIGUENZA) AS TO WHICH HAD BEEN THE BETTER KNIGHT, PALMERIN OF
ENGLAND OR AMADIS OF GAUL. MASTER NICHOLAS, THE VILLAGE BARBER, HOWEVER, USED TO
SAY THAT NEITHER OF THEM CAME UP TO THE KNIGHT OF PHOEBUS, AND THAT IF THERE WAS
ANY THAT COULD COMPARE WITH HIM IT WAS DON GALAOR, THE BROTHER OF AMADIS OF
GAUL, BECAUSE HE HAD A SPIRIT THAT WAS EQUAL TO EVERY OCCASION, AND WAS NO FINIKIN
KNIGHT, NOR LACHRYMOSE LIKE HIS BROTHER, WHILE IN THE MATTER OF VALOUR HE WAS NOT A
WHIT BEHIND HIM. IN SHORT, HE BECAME SO ABSORBED IN HIS BOOKS THAT HE SPENT HIS
NIGHTS FROM SUNSET TO SUNRISE, AND HIS DAYS FROM DAWN TO DARK, PORING OVER THEM;
AND WHAT WITH LITTLE SLEEP AND MUCH READING HIS BRAINS GOT SO DRY THAT HE LOST HIS
WITS. HIS FANCY GREW FULL OF WHAT HE USED TO READ ABOUT IN HIS BOOKS, ENCHANTMENTS, QUARRELS, BATTLES, CHALLENGES, WOUNDS, WOOINGS, LOVES, AGONIES, AND ALL
SORTS OF IMPOSSIBLE NONSENSE; AND IT SO POSSESSED HIS MIND THAT THE WHOLE FABRIC
OF INVENTION AND FANCY HE READ OF WAS TRUE, THAT TO HIM NO HISTORY IN THE WORLD HAD
MORE REALITY IN IT. HE USED TO SAY THE CID RUY DIAZ WAS A VERY GOOD KNIGHT, BUT
THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE KNIGHT OF THE BURNING SWORD WHO WITH
ONE BACK-STROKE CUT IN HALF TWO FIERCE AND MONSTROUS GIANTS. HE THOUGHT MORE OF
BERNARDO DEL CARPIO BECAUSE AT RONCESVALLES HE SLEW ROLAND IN SPITE OF ENCHANTMENTS, AVAILING HIMSELF OF THE ARTIFICE OF HERCULES WHEN HE STRANGLED ANTAEUS THE
SON OF TERRA IN HIS ARMS. HE APPROVED HIGHLY OF THE GIANT MORGANTE, BECAUSE, AL-
THOUGH OF THE GIANT BREED WHICH IS ALWAYS ARROGANT AND ILL-CONDITIONED, HE ALONE
WAS AFFABLE AND WELL-BRED. BUT ABOVE ALL HE ADMIRED REINALDOS OF MONTALBAN, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE SAW HIM SALLYING FORTH FROM HIS CASTLE AND ROBBING EVERYONE HE
MET, AND WHEN BEYOND THE SEAS HE STOLE THAT IMAGE OF MAHOMET WHICH, AS HIS HISTORY SAYS, WAS ENTIRELY OF GOLD. TO HAVE A BOUT OF KICKING AT THAT TRAITOR OF A
GANELON HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS HOUSEKEEPER, AND HIS NIECE INTO THE BARGAIN.
IN SHORT, HIS WITS BEING QUITE GONE, HE HIT UPON THE STRANGEST NOTION THAT EVER
MADMAN IN THIS WORLD HIT UPON, AND THAT WAS THAT HE FANCIED IT WAS RIGHT AND REQUISITE, AS WELL FOR THE SUPPORT OF HIS OWN HONOUR AS FOR THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY,
THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A KNIGHT-ERRANT OF HIMSELF, ROAMING THE WORLD OVER IN FULL ARMOUR AND ON HORSEBACK IN QUEST OF ADVENTURES, AND PUTTING IN PRACTICE HIMSELF ALL
THAT HE HAD READ OF AS BEING THE USUAL PRACTICES OF KNIGHTS-ERRANT; RIGHTING EVERY
KIND OF WRONG, AND EXPOSING HIMSELF TO PERIL AND DANGER FROM WHICH, IN THE ISSUE,
HE WAS TO REAP ETERNAL RENOWN AND FAME. ALREADY THE POOR MAN SAW HIMSELF
CROWNED BY THE MIGHT OF HIS ARM EMPEROR OF TREBIZOND AT LEAST; AND SO, LED AWAY
BY THE INTENSE ENJOYMENT HE FOUND IN THESE PLEASANT FANCIES, HE SET HIMSELF FORTHWITH TO PUT HIS SCHEME INTO EXECUTION.
THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO CLEAN UP SOME ARMOUR THAT HAD BELONGED TO HIS
GREAT-GRANDFATHER, AND HAD BEEN FOR AGES LYING FORGOTTEN IN A CORNER EATEN WITH
RUST AND COVERED WITH MILDEW. HE SCOURED AND POLISHED IT AS BEST HE COULD, BUT HE
PERCEIVED ONE GREAT DEFECT IN IT, THAT IT HAD NO CLOSED HELMET, NOTHING BUT A SIMPLE
MORION. THIS DEFICIENCY, HOWEVER, HIS INGENUITY SUPPLIED, FOR HE CONTRIVED A KIND
OF HALF-HELMET OF PASTEBOARD WHICH, FITTED ON TO THE MORION, LOOKED LIKE A WHOLE
ONE. IT IS TRUE THAT, IN ORDER TO SEE IF IT WAS STRONG AND FIT TO STAND A CUT, HE DREW
HIS SWORD AND GAVE IT A COUPLE OF SLASHES, THE FIRST OF WHICH UNDID IN AN INSTANT
WHAT HAD TAKEN HIM A WEEK TO DO. THE EASE WITH WHICH HE HAD KNOCKED IT TO
PIECES DISCONCERTED HIM SOMEWHAT, AND TO GUARD AGAINST THAT DANGER HE SET TO
WORK AGAIN, FIXING BARS OF IRON ON THE INSIDE UNTIL HE WAS SATISFIED WITH ITS
STRENGTH; AND THEN, NOT CARING TO TRY ANY MORE EXPERIMENTS WITH IT, HE PASSED IT
AND ADOPTED IT AS A HELMET OF THE MOST PERFECT CONSTRUCTION.
HE NEXT PROCEEDED TO INSPECT HIS HACK, WHICH, WITH MORE QUARTOS THAN A REAL
AND MORE BLEMISHES THAN THE STEED OF GONELA, THAT “TANTUM PELLIS ET OSSA FUIT,” SURPASSED IN HIS EYES THE BUCEPHALUS OF ALEXANDER OR THE BABIECA OF THE CID. FOUR
DAYS WERE SPENT IN THINKING WHAT NAME TO GIVE HIM, BECAUSE (AS HE SAID TO HIMSELF) IT WAS NOT RIGHT THAT A HORSE BELONGING TO A KNIGHT SO FAMOUS, AND ONE WITH
SUCH MERITS OF HIS OWN, SHOULD BE WITHOUT SOME DISTINCTIVE NAME, AND HE STROVE TO
ADAPT IT SO AS TO INDICATE WHAT HE HAD BEEN BEFORE BELONGING TO A KNIGHT-ERRANT,
AND WHAT HE THEN WAS; FOR IT WAS ONLY REASONABLE THAT, HIS MASTER TAKING A NEW
CHARACTER, HE SHOULD TAKE A NEW NAME, AND THAT IT SHOULD BE A DISTINGUISHED AND
FULL-SOUNDING ONE, BEFITTING THE NEW ORDER AND CALLING HE WAS ABOUT TO FOLLOW.
AND SO, AFTER HAVING COMPOSED, STRUCK OUT, REJECTED, ADDED TO, UNMADE, AND REMADE A MULTITUDE OF NAMES OUT OF HIS MEMORY AND FANCY, HE DECIDED UPON CALLING
HIM ROCINANTE, A NAME, TO HIS THINKING, LOFTY, SONOROUS, AND SIGNIFICANT OF HIS CON-
DITION AS A HACK BEFORE HE BECAME WHAT HE NOW WAS, THE FIRST AND FOREMOST OF ALL
THE HACKS IN THE WORLD.
“BE NOT ANGRY, MASTER MINE,” REPLIED SANCHO, “I DID NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT;”
AND COMING CLOSE TO HIM HE LAID ONE HAND ON THE POMMEL OF THE SADDLE AND THE
OTHER ON THE CANTLE SO THAT HE HELD HIS MASTER’S LEFT THIGH IN HIS EMBRACE, NOT DARING TO SEPARATE A FINGER’S WIDTH FROM HIM; SO MUCH AFRAID WAS HE OF THE STROKES
WHICH STILL RESOUNDED WITH A REGULAR BEAT. DON QUIXOTE BADE HIM TELL SOME STORY
TO AMUSE HIM AS HE HAD PROPOSED, TO WHICH SANCHO REPLIED THAT HE WOULD IF HIS
DREAD OF WHAT HE HEARD WOULD LET HIM; “STILL,” SAID HE, “I WILL STRIVE TO TELL A STORY
WHICH, IF I CAN MANAGE TO RELATE IT, AND NOBODY INTERFERES WITH THE TELLING, IS THE
BEST OF STORIES, AND LET YOUR WORSHIP GIVE ME YOUR ATTENTION, FOR HERE I BEGIN.
WHAT WAS, WAS; AND MAY THE GOOD THAT IS TO COME BE FOR ALL, AND THE EVIL FOR HIM
WHO GOES TO LOOK FOR IT -YOUR WORSHIP MUST KNOW THAT THE BEGINNING THE OLD FOLK
USED TO PUT TO THEIR TALES WAS NOT JUST AS EACH ONE PLEASED; IT WAS A MAXIM OF CATO
ZONZORINO THE ROMAN, THAT SAYS ‘THE EVIL FOR HIM THAT GOES TO LOOK FOR IT,’ AND IT
COMES AS PAT TO THE PURPOSE NOW AS RING TO FINGER, TO SHOW THAT YOUR WORSHIP
SHOULD KEEP QUIET AND NOT GO LOOKING FOR EVIL IN ANY QUARTER, AND THAT WE SHOULD
GO BACK BY SOME OTHER ROAD, SINCE NOBODY FORCES US TO FOLLOW THIS IN WHICH SO
MANY TERRORS AFFRIGHT US.”
“GO ON WITH THY STORY, SANCHO,” SAID DON QUIXOTE, “AND LEAVE THE CHOICE OF
OUR ROAD TO MY CARE.”
“I SAY THEN,” CONTINUED SANCHO, “THAT IN A VILLAGE OF ESTREMADURA THERE WAS A
GOAT-SHEPHERD -THAT IS TO SAY, ONE WHO TENDED GOATS- WHICH SHEPHERD OR GOATHERD,
AS MY STORY GOES, WAS CALLED LOPE RUIZ, AND THIS LOPE RUIZ WAS IN LOVE WITH A
SHEPHERDESS CALLED TORRALVA, WHICH SHEPHERDESS CALLED TORRALVA WAS THE DAUGHTER
OF A RICH GRAZIER, AND THIS RICH GRAZIER-”
“IF THAT IS THE WAY THOU TELLEST THY TALE, SANCHO,” SAID DON QUIXOTE, “REPEATING
TWICE ALL THOU HAST TO SAY, THOU WILT NOT HAVE DONE THESE TWO DAYS; GO STRAIGHT ON
WITH IT, AND TELL IT LIKE A REASONABLE MAN, OR ELSE SAY NOTHING.”
“TALES ARE ALWAYS TOLD IN MY COUNTRY IN THE VERY WAY I AM TELLING THIS,” ANSWERED SANCHO, “AND I CANNOT TELL IT IN ANY OTHER, NOR IS IT RIGHT OF YOUR WORSHIP TO
ASK ME TO MAKE NEW CUSTOMS.”
“TELL IT AS THOU WILT,” REPLIED DON QUIXOTE; “AND AS FATE WILL HAVE IT THAT I CANNOT HELP LISTENING TO THEE, GO ON.”
“AND SO, LORD OF MY SOUL,” CONTINUED SANCHO, AS I HAVE SAID, THIS SHEPHERD
WAS IN LOVE WITH TORRALVA THE SHEPHERDESS, WHO WAS A WILD BUXOM LASS WITH SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF A MAN ABOUT HER, FOR SHE HAD LITTLE MOUSTACHES; I FANCY I SEE
HER NOW."
“THEN YOU KNEW HER?” SAID DON QUIXOTE.
“I DID NOT KNOW HER,” SAID SANCHO, “BUT HE WHO TOLD ME THE STORY SAID IT WAS
SO TRUE AND CERTAIN THAT WHEN I TOLD IT TO ANOTHER I MIGHT SAFELY DECLARE AND SWEAR I
HAD SEEN IT ALL MYSELF. AND SO IN COURSE OF TIME, THE DEVIL, WHO NEVER SLEEPS AND
PUTS EVERYTHING IN CONFUSION, CONTRIVED THAT THE LOVE THE SHEPHERD BORE THE SHEPHERDESS TURNED INTO HATRED AND ILL-WILL, AND THE REASON, ACCORDING TO EVIL TONGUES,
WAS SOME LITTLE JEALOUSY SHE CAUSED HIM THAT CROSSED THE LINE AND TRESPASSED ON
FORBIDDEN GROUND; AND SO MUCH DID THE SHEPHERD HATE HER FROM THAT TIME FORWARD
THAT, IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM HER, HE DETERMINED TO QUIT THE COUNTRY AND GO WHERE
HE SHOULD NEVER SET EYES ON HER AGAIN. TORRALVA, WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF SPURNED
BY LOPE, WAS IMMEDIATELY SMITTEN WITH LOVE FOR HIM, THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER LOVED
HIM BEFORE.”
“THAT IS THE NATURAL WAY OF WOMEN,” SAID DON QUIXOTE, “TO SCORN THE ONE THAT
LOVES THEM, AND LOVE THE ONE THAT HATES THEM: GO ON, SANCHO.”
“IT CAME TO PASS,” SAID SANCHO, “THAT THE SHEPHERD CARRIED OUT HIS INTENTION,
AND DRIVING HIS GOATS BEFORE HIM TOOK HIS WAY ACROSS THE PLAINS OF ESTREMADURA TO
PASS OVER INTO THE KINGDOM OF PORTUGAL. TORRALVA, WHO KNEW OF IT, WENT AFTER HIM,
AND ON FOOT AND BAREFOOT FOLLOWED HIM AT A DISTANCE, WITH A PILGRIM’S STAFF IN HER
HAND AND A SCRIP ROUND HER NECK, IN WHICH SHE CARRIED, IT IS SAID, A BIT OF LOOKINGGLASS AND A PIECE OF A COMB AND SOME LITTLE POT OR OTHER OF PAINT FOR HER FACE; BUT
LET HER CARRY WHAT SHE DID, I AM NOT GOING TO TROUBLE MYSELF TO PROVE IT; ALL I SAY IS,
THAT THE SHEPHERD, THEY SAY, CAME WITH HIS FLOCK TO CROSS OVER THE RIVER GUADIANA,
WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME SWOLLEN AND ALMOST OVERFLOWING ITS BANKS, AND AT THE SPOT
HE CAME TO THERE WAS NEITHER FERRY NOR BOAT NOR ANYONE TO CARRY HIM OR HIS FLOCK TO
THE OTHER SIDE, AT WHICH HE WAS MUCH VEXED, FOR HE PERCEIVED THAT TORRALVA WAS APPROACHING AND WOULD GIVE HIM GREAT ANNOYANCE WITH HER TEARS AND ENTREATIES; HOWEVER, HE WENT LOOKING ABOUT SO CLOSELY THAT HE DISCOVERED A FISHERMAN WHO HAD
ALONGSIDE OF HIM A BOAT SO SMALL THAT IT COULD ONLY HOLD ONE PERSON AND ONE GOAT;
BUT FOR ALL THAT HE SPOKE TO HIM AND AGREED WITH HIM TO CARRY HIMSELF AND HIS THREE
HUNDRED GOATS ACROSS. THE FISHERMAN GOT INTO THE BOAT AND CARRIED ONE GOAT OVER;
HE CAME BACK AND CARRIED ANOTHER OVER; HE CAME BACK AGAIN, AND AGAIN BROUGHT
OVER ANOTHER- LET YOUR WORSHIP KEEP COUNT OF THE GOATS THE FISHERMAN IS TAKING
ACROSS, FOR IF ONE ESCAPES THE MEMORY THERE WILL BE AN END OF THE STORY, AND IT WILL
BE IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL ANOTHER WORD OF IT. TO PROCEED, I MUST TELL YOU THE LANDING
PLACE ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS MIRY AND SLIPPERY, AND THE FISHERMAN LOST A GREAT DEAL
OF TIME IN GOING AND COMING; STILL HE RETURNED FOR ANOTHER GOAT, AND ANOTHER, AND
ANOTHER.”
“TAKE IT FOR GRANTED HE BROUGHT THEM ALL ACROSS,” SAID DON QUIXOTE, “AND
DON’T KEEP GOING AND COMING IN THIS WAY, OR THOU WILT NOT MAKE AN END OF BRINGING THEM OVER THIS TWELVEMONTH.”
“HOW MANY HAVE GONE ACROSS SO FAR?” SAID SANCHO.
“HOW THE DEVIL DO I KNOW?” REPLIED DON QUIXOTE.
“THERE IT IS,” SAID SANCHO, “WHAT I TOLD YOU, THAT YOU MUST KEEP A GOOD COUNT;
WELL THEN, BY GOD, THERE IS AN END OF THE STORY, FOR THERE IS NO GOING ANY FARTHER.”
“HOW CAN THAT BE?” SAID DON QUIXOTE; “IS IT SO ESSENTIAL TO THE STORY TO KNOW
TO A NICETY THE GOATS THAT HAVE CROSSED OVER, THAT IF THERE BE A MISTAKE OF ONE IN THE
RECKONING, THOU CANST NOT GO ON WITH IT?”
“NO, SENOR, NOT A BIT,” REPLIED SANCHO; “FOR WHEN I ASKED YOUR WORSHIP TO TELL
ME HOW MANY GOATS HAD CROSSED, AND YOU ANSWERED YOU DID NOT KNOW, AT THAT
VERY INSTANT ALL I HAD TO SAY PASSED AWAY OUT OF MY MEMORY, AND, FAITH, THERE WAS
MUCH VIRTUE IN IT, AND ENTERTAINMENT.”
“SO, THEN,” SAID DON QUIXOTE, “THE STORY HAS COME TO AN END?”
“AS MUCH AS MY MOTHER HAS,” SAID SANCHO.
“IN TRUTH,” SAID DON QUIXOTE, “THOU HAST TOLD ONE OF THE RAREST STORIES, TALES, OR
HISTORIES, THAT ANYONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE IMAGINED, AND SUCH A WAY OF TELLING
IT AND ENDING IT WAS NEVER SEEN NOR WILL BE IN A LIFETIME; THOUGH I EXPECTED NOTHING ELSE FROM THY EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING. BUT I DO NOT WONDER, FOR PERHAPS THOSE
CEASELESS STROKES MAY HAVE CONFUSED THY WITS.”
“ALL THAT MAY BE,” REPLIED SANCHO, “BUT I KNOW THAT AS TO MY STORY, ALL THAT CAN
BE SAID IS THAT IT ENDS THERE WHERE THE MISTAKE IN THE COUNT OF THE PASSAGE OF THE
GOATS BEGINS.”
“LET IT END WHERE IT WILL, WELL AND GOOD,” SAID DON QUIXOTE, “AND LET US SEE IF
ROCINANTE CAN GO;” AND AGAIN HE SPURRED HIM, AND AGAIN ROCINANTE MADE JUMPS
AND REMAINED WHERE HE WAS, SO WELL TIED WAS HE.
JUST THEN, WHETHER IT WAS THE COLD OF THE MORNING THAT WAS NOW APPROACHING,
OR THAT HE HAD EATEN SOMETHING LAXATIVE AT SUPPER, OR THAT IT WAS ONLY NATURAL (AS IS
MOST LIKELY), SANCHO FELT A DESIRE TO DO WHAT NO ONE COULD DO FOR HIM; BUT SO GREAT
WAS THE FEAR THAT HAD PENETRATED HIS HEART, HE DARED NOT SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM HIS
MASTER BY AS MUCH AS THE BLACK OF HIS NAIL; TO ESCAPE DOING WHAT HE WANTED WAS,
HOWEVER, ALSO IMPOSSIBLE; SO WHAT HE DID FOR PEACE’S SAKE WAS TO REMOVE HIS RIGHT
HAND, WHICH HELD THE BACK OF THE SADDLE, AND WITH IT TO UNTIE GENTLY AND SILENTLY
THE RUNNING STRING WHICH ALONE HELD UP HIS BREECHES, SO THAT ON LOOSENING IT THEY
AT ONCE FELL DOWN ROUND HIS FEET LIKE FETTERS; HE THEN RAISED HIS SHIRT AS WELL AS HE
COULD AND BARED HIS HIND QUARTERS, NO SLIM ONES. BUT, THIS ACCOMPLISHED, WHICH HE
FANCIED WAS ALL HE HAD TO DO TO GET OUT OF THIS TERRIBLE STRAIT AND EMBARRASSMENT, ANOTHER STILL GREATER DIFFICULTY PRESENTED ITSELF, FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM IMPOSSIBLE TO RELIEVE HIMSELF WITHOUT MAKING SOME NOISE, AND HE GROUND HIS TEETH AND SQUEEZED
HIS SHOULDERS TOGETHER, HOLDING HIS BREATH AS MUCH AS HE COULD; BUT IN SPITE OF HIS
PRECAUTIONS HE WAS UNLUCKY ENOUGH AFTER ALL TO MAKE A LITTLE NOISE, VERY DIFFERENT
FROM THAT WHICH WAS CAUSING HIM SO MUCH FEAR.
DON QUIXOTE, HEARING IT, SAID, “WHAT NOISE IS THAT, SANCHO?”
“I DON’T KNOW, SENOR,” SAID HE; “IT MUST BE SOMETHING NEW, FOR ADVENTURES AND
MISADVENTURES NEVER BEGIN WITH A TRIFLE.” ONCE MORE HE TRIED HIS LUCK, AND SUCCEEDED SO WELL, THAT WITHOUT ANY FURTHER NOISE OR DISTURBANCE HE FOUND HIMSELF RELIEVED OF THE BURDEN THAT HAD GIVEN HIM SO MUCH DISCOMFORT. BUT AS DON
QUIXOTE’S SENSE OF SMELL WAS AS ACUTE AS HIS HEARING, AND AS SANCHO WAS SO
CLOSELY LINKED WITH HIM THAT THE FUMES ROSE ALMOST IN A STRAIGHT LINE, IT COULD NOT
BE BUT THAT SOME SHOULD REACH HIS NOSE, AND AS SOON AS THEY DID HE CAME TO ITS RELIEF BY COMPRESSING IT BETWEEN HIS FINGERS, SAYING IN A RATHER SNUFFING TONE, “SANCHO, IT STRIKES ME THOU ART IN GREAT FEAR.”
